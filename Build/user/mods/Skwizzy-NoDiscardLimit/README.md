## Description ##
Simple server side mod that marks all items with DiscardLimits as InsuranceDisabled. It then disables the DiscardLimit settings for the server via the EnableDiscardLimits option in Server/database/globals.json. 

SPT PMC bots by default spawn with loot already in their backpacks, this loot is not marked Found In Raid and thus is subject to BSG's RMT protection logic. With discard limits enabled, when a bot drops their backback to swap to a new one any loot with discard limits in their bag will be deleted immediately when the bag is dropped. To avoid this we set the EnableDiscardLimits to false, and also make sure to flag all items with a DiscardLimit >= 0 as InsuranceDisabled to prevent items suchs as keys and cases to be insured.
